**BetaOnline** was a Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 server that ran from March 6th, 2022 to March 31st, 2025. 

The aim of BetaOnline was to bring a semi-vanilla SMP experience to the old Minecraft community, which was dominated by massive overpopulated, pay-to-win servers with way too many rules and bloated plugins. Unlike other servers at the time, BetaOnline ran with no big game-changing plugins such as economy or other bloat. The laid-back approach to moderation and the staunch free-speech values of the server quickly made BetaOnline prospher with activity, with the server regularly reaching the top of the [BetaCraft](https://betacraft.uk/) server listing. This lightning in a bottle produced a healthy and dedicated community; wars between players were waged, lore was written, even a wiki was created and maintained by the playerbase.

Like all good things, however, it must come to an end. After a prolonged lack of activity, the decision was made to shut down BetaOnline in March 2025.
